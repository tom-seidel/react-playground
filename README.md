# react-playground

Welcome to my React Playground! ⚛️  
This repository contains small React experiments and learning snippets created while exploring the React ecosystem.

The focus is on understanding core concepts like components, props, state, effects, and hooks – in a simple, structured, and beginner-friendly way.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in this repository is a self-contained mini app or concept demo, with its own purpose and learning goal.  
Here’s what you’ll typically find inside each project:

- A minimal setup using `create-react-app` or Vite
- Clean component structure
- Descriptive folder and file names
- Minimal styling (sometimes with Tailwind or plain CSS)

## 🎯 Why this repo?

This repo exists as a place to break things, try things, and learn React from the ground up.  
Unlike [`react-projects`](https://github.com/tom-seidel/react-projects), which contains more polished and complete apps, this space is more experimental and sandbox-like.

Think of it as my personal React lab. 🧪

## ✅ Topics covered (so far)

- Functional components
- JSX and props
- useState and useEffect
- Conditional rendering
- Event handling
- Component composition
- Controlled inputs
- Custom hooks (in progress)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This playground will grow as I explore more advanced patterns, hooks, and performance techniques.

Pull requests, ideas, or feedback are always welcome!
